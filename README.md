I know the newest nightly build of webkit has a backdrop filter option that will soon replace this. For those who want to support this now can use this repo as a guide.  

#To Run:

1. Open 'index.html' in a browser with cssfilter blur support

#To Develop:

1. Have nodeJS installed

2. Have webpack installed globally (npm i webpack -g)

3. Install dependencies (npm i)

4. Run **webpack** to build

5. Run **webpack -w** to watch/build

6. Run **webpack -p** to minify build
